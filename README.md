# React & Electron App

Base setup for building React projects with Electron.
First install all dependencies then run `npm run watch` in one terminal, to open the Electron window just use `npm start` in other console.

*Note:* By saving your js files you will be able to see the changes in your react app without having to reload it yourself.
